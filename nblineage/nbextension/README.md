# Jupyter-LC\_nblineage

Jupyter-LC\_nblineage is an extension that put tracking ID, which we call *meme*, to every notebook and every cell in it.
* The meme will be newly assigned as UUID1 when a cell or a notebook has been created and saved at first time
* Each meme is stored in metadata, thus it would be inherited into diverged notebooks and copied cells
* `new-root-meme` subcommand will make a copy of a notebook and reassign new memes to a duplicated notebook and to cells within it

# Usage

Jupyter-LC\_nblineage includes an extension and a command line tool.

## extension

The extension generates meme metadata in order to track lineage of notebooks and cells.

Example of notebook's meme at `lc_notebook_meme` in notebook metadata.

```

  "lc_notebook_meme": {
    "current": "1904d564-71c6-11e7-8369-0242ac110002",         ## The meme id for this notebook
    "lc_server_signature": {

        }
      ]
    },

## new-root-meme command line tool

This subcommand will make a copy of a notebook and reassign new meme IDs to the duplicated notebook and to the cells within it.

        $ jupyter nblineage new-root-meme <source.ipynb> <reassigned.ipynb>
